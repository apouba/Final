# Final
I actually started appreciating technology when I was younger because I was interested in the creative parts such as Powerpoint and Paint. I never thought I was good at "art in the real world" or physically painting, drawing, all the usual common forms of art. So I think it is pretty fitting to create an art piece on the internet for me.
