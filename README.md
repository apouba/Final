# Kids drawing - Interactive/Responsive
I actually started appreciating technology when I was younger because I was interested in the creative parts such as Powerpoint and Paint. I never thought I was good at “art in the real  world” or physically painting, drawing, all the common forms of art. I have recently gotten away from that mindset, even taking a drawing class, but really contemplating what I can do as a creative and what constitutes as art. With my love for technology, people, and design, I thought a CSS art piece would be a perfect idea to demonstrate this mixture. 
I left some of the components of this piece to be responsive to the browser window and screen size because I thought it was a nice way to show the difference between a simple childish drawing, and what can now be done on the computer. The new way of doing the same thing with some added spice.
